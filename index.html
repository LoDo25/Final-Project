      <p>Welcome to Lauren's World! I think the right phrase for me to use here is... It's about time. After years working in the digital field I taken the leap, I've entered the world of <strong>code</strong> and my what a journey. So for those who are visiting for the first time – It's a pleasure to meet you. For those who have somehow managed to stumble upon my site – It’s about time we met.</p>

      <p>So without further ado, let's jump into the nitty-gritty and discuss the how, what, where, and most importantly who? </p>

      <p><strong><em>In a Nutshell.</em></strong></p>
      <p>Born and raised in a loving home in London, England I was the first child of what lead to be many. Starting young I fell in love with being on the stage and all thing theatre, if you had asked me back then I was going to be a 'Star.' After being humbled and school very quickly about the importance of a well rounded education and what it meant to truly be in the limelight, I quickly shifted my focus. Through my early to late teens my dedication was directed towards balancing a full time education, employment at local councils as well as a budding basketball career. My education lead to studying Business and Marketing Management at Oxford Brookes University with both coaching and captaincy opportunities on the women's basketball team. Upon completion of this, I decided to spread my wings and search for international opportunities. </p>

      <p><strong><em>To the seas, and beyond.</em></strong></p>
      <p>As recent graduate, I was more that ready to see what working abroad truly meant. Little did I know back then that this would be the first international leap of many. I started this venture with a basketball coaching opportunity in Wilmot, New Hampshire, US. After thoroughly enjoying the experience, the travel and the people I met along the way I returned for a second summer spending the rest of the year developing my marketing experience. Through the power of networking I managed to gain an introduction to a US production agency (Global Entertainment and Media), which later became GEM. I learnt very quickly that fate was on my side and that if I worked hard enough I would eventually be on the path to my, dare I say it, dream job. The following year, I took began working full time at GEM in New Haven, Connecticut. </p>

      <p><strong><em>This is me, now.</em></strong></p>
      <p>After being with GEM for 3 years I was ready to start my next chapter, ready for a new challenge I had been working tirelessly on behalf of both company and clients so it was not a surprise to clients, colleges, family or friends when I told them that not only would I be staying with the company in a longer capacity, but I was being tasked with a new more fitting role to helm a new office in none other than, Vancouver, BC. So, that is it. Here I am am, a Brit, in her late twenties living the Canadian dream here in Vancouver.</p>
